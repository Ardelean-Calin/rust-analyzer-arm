# rust-analyzer-arm
The rust-analyzer language server compiled for the ARMv7 instruction set.

This repository contains a single **Github Workflow** which fetches the latest [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) release and compiles it for ARMv7.
Currently this workflow runs daily, not on pull request, but this may be improved in the future.
